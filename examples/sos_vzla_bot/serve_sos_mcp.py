"""Serve the SOS Venezuela surface as a hosted MCP endpoint (Mode B), locally.

This is the same comprehension MCP that would run at mcp.geckovision.tech — but on
your laptop, so you can test the real product flow with zero deploy:

    uv run --extra serve python -m examples.sos_vzla_bot.serve_sos_mcp

Then add  http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp  as an MCP server in Claude Code / Cursor and call
the SOS tools — they hit the LIVE SOS Venezuela API through surfcall (mode="live").
