"""Pegana first-call-correct scorecard (recorded, $0) — the second painful API.

Ingests the committed Pegana OpenAPI surface unilaterally (it is NOT in any catalog),
comprehends it with a PUBLIC (no-auth) session, and scores first-call-correctness on
representative tasks — including the real gotchas from Gecko's hand-integration. Thin
CLI: the logic lives in ``surfcall.evaluate`` and the engine; this file is transport.
