"""Flow-A x402 billing — Gecko collects its OWN flat per-surface subscription in USDC.

This is Gecko charging its own fee for keeping a painful API first-call-correct and
drift-watched. It is emphatically **NOT** a rail-for-others, **NOT** a take-rate, and
**NOT** per-call metering. The 402 fires only on the cloud subscribe/renew path
(spec: private/2026-07-01-monetization-and-cloud-spec.md §2/§3). This module mints the
402 payment requirements and, on the return leg, validates + settles a subscription into
a control-plane ``cloud`` entitlement.

Hard invariants (structural, not just policy):

1. **No signer, no broadcast.** This module signs nothing and sends no transaction.
   Settlement is delegated to an INJECTED ``FacilitatorClient`` — a deterministic FAKE in
   D1 (offline, no keys/network). Any real mainnet broadcast is founder-run only; the
   customer wallet / facilitator broadcasts, never the Gecko server, never Claude.
2. **Control-plane only.** Persists ONLY ``{entitlement, expires_at, opaque payment_ref}``
   (in ``Entitlements``). NEVER the USDC, a wallet key, the ``X-PAYMENT`` payload, or any
   response body. ``payment_ref`` is an opaque dedupe key (like ``cred_ref``), not custody.
3. **``X402_MODE=stub`` is the DEFAULT** — ``FakeFacilitator`` + auto-grant; cloud
   user-testing needs no real USDC. ``live`` needs an injected real facilitator and is
   never flipped without founder go-ahead.
4. **Neutrality.** The facilitator, treasury (``pay_to``), USDC mint (``asset``), and
   network are all injected/config — never hardcoded to one provider/wallet/chain.

``now`` is always injected (no argless clock — deterministic tests + the repo rule).
