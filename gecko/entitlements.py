"""Entitlements — which customer may access which surface, and how.

Day-one model (docs/decisions/2026-06-28-day-one-model.md), build slice 2. Maps
``(customer_id, surface_id)`` to an access kind: ``public`` (a public surface the
customer connected) or ``byok`` (a paid/auth surface the customer provisioned with
their own credential).

**Control-plane discipline:** an entitlement stores a ``cred_ref`` — an OPAQUE
REFERENCE to a BYOK credential (e.g. ``vault://cust_1/pegana``) — and NEVER the secret
value itself (invariant #1). That keeps this layer custody-agnostic: the reference can
point at an encrypted store or be re-resolved per session — the open store-vs-never-store
decision lives behind the reference, not here.

``surfaces_for(customer_id)`` returns the customer's own connected set — the basis for
**per-customer, intra-set discovery**. There is deliberately no cross-customer or global
view (that would be the marketplace catalog we never build).
